      <p>I have always loved working with computers since I was a child as they have allowed my creativity to flourish throughout my life. The world is always developing new technologies, and I am excited to be part of it all. I am experienced with web development technology like Javascript, CSS, and HTML. I am formally trained in Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. I have hands-on experience as a graduate of the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp and enjoy learning programming languages and creating and designing responsive web pages. My strengths are organization, the ability to remain optimistic and calm under pressure, and that I am a lifelong learner willing to learn quickly and work hard. My passion for this industry combined with my technical skill set and ability to take on challenges of all sizes, prepare me for a future as a Front-End Web Developer.</p>
